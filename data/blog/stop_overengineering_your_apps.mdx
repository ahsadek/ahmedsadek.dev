## Introduction

One thing I've learned after programming for four years is that **not everything needs to be over-engineered**. Sometimes, the simplest solution really is the best.

The development world is full of advice about "best practices" and "proper architecture", but here's the truth: **speed matters**. **Shipping matters**. And your ability to get things done efficiently is what makes you valuable in the industry.

This post will cover practical strategies for avoiding over engineering:

1. **Choose the Right Tool for the Job**: when to use website builders vs. custom code
2. **Smart Coding Practices**: leveraging AI and existing solutions
3. **Technology Selection**: picking tools with strong community support
4. **Filtering Advice**: learning to trust your judgment

## Choose the Right Tool for the Job

For marketing websites, e-commerce stores, or quick MVPs, drop the ego and use a website builder. From simple, out-of-the-box options like Squarespace to highly customizable tools like Webflow, or even niche platforms like Shopify, if it fits your needs, just use what works.

These platforms usually come with SEO built in and designs that look great out of the box. If a website builder can get you 80% of the way there in 20% of the time, that's often the right choice. Free yourself to focus on what actually matters.

## Use AI and Existing Solutions

When it comes to MVPs, don't be afraid to **"vibe code"**, spin up boilerplate quickly, use AI to get past the project initialization, but **never depend on it**. If you're not using a tool like **Cursor** (or any good AI code completion agent), start now. I pay the $20/month and I never looked back, it **doubled my productivity** at work. More productivity = more value in this industry.

Another massive time saver: **search GitHub before you code from scratch**. Nine times out of ten, you'll find exactly what you're trying to build. And don't shy away from **forking projects**, it's one of the fastest ways to learn how other developers think and write code.

This **two liner** will literally save you days of development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/similar-project.git
cd similar-project
```

## Use AI-Friendly Tech Stacks

As for tech choices, **stick with what has a strong community behind it** and usually, not always but usually, its the technologies that are currently trending. This isn't about chasing hype; it's about ensuring you'll find answers **quickly** when you get stuck.

Personally, I lean into the stacks that **AI tools love**:

- **Vite / Nextjs** for builds
- **React** for frontend
- **Tailwind** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui** for UI

It means that if things go wrong, I have **documentation**, **community support**, and even **AI-generated fixes** to back me up.

## Filtering Advice: Trust Your Judgment

Finally, **filter the advice you take**. Even senior developers can give you bad takes, and Reddit is full of people who forget about **real-world constraints** like deadlines.

### Red Flags in Development Advice

- Advice that ignores **business constraints**
- Solutions that are **over-engineered** for the problem size
- Recommendations without **context** about scale or requirements
- **Perfectionism** over **pragmatism**
- Advice from people who haven't **shipped recently**

### Learning to Balance

Learn to **trust your judgment** — balance best practices with getting the job done. The best solution is often the one that:

- **Solves the immediate problem**
- **Can be maintained** by your team
- **Delivers value** to users quickly
- **Scales reasonably** with your current needs

## Conclusion: Shipping is Everything

At the end of the day, **speed matters**. **Shipping matters**. And your ability to get things done efficiently is what makes you valuable.

The most elegant architecture in the world is useless if it never sees production. The most "correct" implementation doesn't matter if it takes months to build and the opportunity has passed.

### Key Takeaways

- **Choose tools** that match your project's actual needs
- **Leverage AI** to handle grunt work, but maintain control over architecture
- **Search existing solutions** before building from scratch
- **Pick technologies** with strong community support
- **Filter advice** through the lens of real-world constraints
- **Ship early and iterate** rather than perfect in isolation

Remember: **done is better than perfect**. Your users don't care about your tech stack — they care about whether your product solves their problem.
