## Introduction

One thing I've learned after programming for four years is that **not everything needs to be over-engineered**. Sometimes, the simplest solution is often the best.

The development world is full of advice about "best practices" and "proper architecture", but here's the truth: **speed matters**. **Shipping matters**. And your ability to get things done efficiently is what makes you valuable in the industry.

This post will cover practical strategies for avoiding over-engineering:

1. **Choose the Right Tool for the Job**: when to use website builders vs. custom code
2. **Smart Coding Practices**: leveraging AI and existing solutions
3. **Tech Stack Selection**: picking a stack with a strong community support and that AI loves.

## Choose the Right Tool for the Job

For **marketing websites**, **e-commerce stores**, and mostly **static page sites**, **drop the ego** and use a **website builder**. From simple, out-of-the-box options like **Squarespace** to highly customizable tools like **Webflow**, or even niche platforms like **Shopify** for e-commerce, if it fits your needs, just use what works.

These platforms usually come with **SEO built in** and **designs** that look great out of the box. If a **website builder** can get you **80%** of the way there in **20%** of the time, that's often the right choice. Free yourself to focus on what actually matters.

## Smart Coding Practices

When it comes to **MVPs**, don't be afraid to **"vibe code"** or use an AI website builder tool like **Lovable.dev** or **Bolt.new**. Spin up boilerplate quickly, use AI to get past the project initialization.

During development, If you're not using a tool like **Cursor** (or any kind of AI code completion agent), start now, but **don’t depend on it**. I pay the $20/month on my Cursor subscription and I never looked back, it **tripled my productivity** at work. More productivity = more value.

Another massive time saver: **search GitHub before you code from scratch**. Nine times out of ten, you'll find exactly what you're trying to build. And don't shy away from **forking projects**, it's one of the fastest ways to get a **project / feature** up and running and it’s great to also learn how other developers think and write code.

## Tech Stack Selection

As for tech choices, **stick with what has a strong community behind it**. This isn't about chasing what’s trending but rather about ensuring you'll find answers **quickly** when you get stuck.

Personally, I lean into technologies that **AI tools love**. For example, here’s the **stack** that **Lovable.dev** builds with, the same one I use :

- **Vite** for builds
- **React** for frontend
- **Tailwind** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui** for UI

Doing so means that if things go wrong, not only do I have **documentation** and **community support** to rely on, but also the **LLM models** that are vastly trained on the stack that I’m conveniently using.

## Conclusion: Shipping is Everything

At the end of the day, **speed matters**. **Shipping matters**. And your ability to get things done efficiently is what makes you valuable. The most elegant architecture in the world is useless if it never sees production.
